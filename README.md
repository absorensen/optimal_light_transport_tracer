# optimal_light_transport_tracer
Small rust path tracer based on [smallpt](http://www.kevinbeason.com/smallpt/), to better learn and implement optimal light transport algorithms. Abandoned the project due to shifting priorities. Will probably learn this stuff doing one of the pbrt versions in the future.
